            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
            a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            In 2014 I wanted to learn how to program, but I had no idea where to start. Odin solved that problem for me - it mapped out a series of lesson plans that showed me what to study, without holding my hand or spoon-feeding me information. The curriculum requires hard work and perseverance, but it's worth it. I walked into my first job and felt instantly comfortable with the tools and technologies my employer required. Yes, there was a lot that I didn't know yet, but having done Odin also gave me the confidence to pick up new skills as needed.

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
            next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
