# TESTIMONIAL-PAGE MADE WITH CSS GRID
CSS Grid is a layout system in CSS that allows web developers to create two-dimensional grid layouts for their web pages. With CSS Grid, web developers can define rows and columns, and then place elements into specific grid cells.

Here are some key features of CSS Grid:
```
Two-dimensional layout: CSS Grid allows for both row-based and column-based layout.

Grid lines and tracks: Grid lines define the rows and columns of the grid, while tracks are the spaces between the grid lines.

Grid areas: Grid areas are the cells of the grid that hold content.

Grid container and items: The grid container is the element that contains the grid, while the grid items are the elements that are placed within the grid.

Grid template: The grid template defines the structure of the grid by specifying the number of rows and columns, as well as their size and placement.

Grid properties: CSS Grid offers a number of properties for controlling the placement, size, and spacing of grid items.

Overall, CSS Grid is a powerful tool for creating complex, responsive layouts in web development.
